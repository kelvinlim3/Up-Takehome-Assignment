      <h2>Background</h2>
      <div class="text-box">
        <p>As of November 15, 2021, we have successfully launched the <em>Hook Up a Mate</em> program earlier this year. This initiative was designed to drive customer referrals by offering a $5 cash bonus to both new customers and their referrers throughout January 2021. In February 2021, the incentive was increased to $10, contingent upon the successful sign-up of the referred customer.</p>
        <p>The program also featured a $5 bonus for both customers if the new customer made five purchases within their first 30 days. While every new customer and their referrer received the initial sign-up bonus, only a select group qualified for the additional purchase bonus.</p>
        <p>In this report, we will reveal key insights and findings from our data analysis.</p>

      <h2>Assessing The Impact: What We Achieved As A Business</h2>
      
      <h3>User Sign-Up and Retention Analysis</h3>
      <div class="text-box">
        <p>A total of <strong>6,206</strong> new users joined Up through the <em>Hook Up a Mate</em> program, with a significant increase in February due to the $10 cash bonus incentive:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>January Sign-Ups</strong>: <strong>1,699</strong> users (27%) joined in January, benefiting from the $5 cash bonus incentive.</li>
          <li><strong>February Sign-Ups</strong>: <strong>4,507</strong> users (73%) joined in February, showing the effectiveness of the increased incentive.</li>
          <li><strong>Active Users</strong>: 57% of January sign-ups remain active compared to 40% of February sign-ups, resulting in an overall <strong><em>retention rate</em></strong> of <strong>45%</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: The February cash bonus effectively attracted more new customers. However, the higher retention rate for January sign-ups suggests focusing on strategies to maintain long-term activity.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="bar-chart" class="visual"></div>
      
      <div class="text-box">
        <p>The line chart illustrates the distribution of referrer sign-up dates:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>January 2021 and February 2021 Referrals</strong>: <strong>38%</strong> of referrals were made by customers who also signed up during the <em>Hook Up a Mate</em> program, suggesting that people are incentivised to sign up even without a referral. The concept of providing referrals and still receiving a bonus appeals to them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: The program's referral bonuses effectively increased customer engagement and participation. Future strategies should continue to leverage referral incentives to maintain and boost customer acquisition.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="line-chart" class="visual"></div>
      
      <h3>Bonus Payout Analysis</h3>
      <div class="text-box">
        <p>The diagram below illustrates the distribution of a total of <strong>$131,200</strong> in bonuses paid to new customers. Key observations include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sign-Up Bonuses</strong>: Out of the total, <strong>$107,130</strong> (82%) was dedicated to sign-up bonuses. These were further divided into:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>January</strong>: <strong>$16,990</strong> (13%) for customers who joined in January.</li>
              <li><strong>February</strong>: <strong>$90,140</strong> (69%) for those who signed up in February.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Fifth Purchase Bonuses</strong>: An additional <strong>$24,070</strong> (18%) was awarded to customers who made their fifth purchase within 30 days of joining.</li>
        </ul>        
        <p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: The substantial allocation of bonuses towards sign-ups, particularly in February, highlights the effectiveness of the $10 incentive in attracting new customers. However, the <strong><em>customer acquisition cost</em></strong> for this program was <strong>$21.10</strong>, which might be a significant expense depending on the revenue generated per user. While these bonuses have proven effective in acquiring new users, future marketing strategies should carefully consider the cost implications and ensure that the incentives are sustainable and aligned with long-term profitability.</p>

      <h2>Unveiling The Insights: What We Learned About Our Customers</h2>
      
      <h3>Generation Distribution Analysis</h3>
      <div class="text-box">
        <p>The donut chart displays the age distribution of new customers in the <em>Hook Up a Mate</em> program.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Gen Z</strong>: Represents the largest segment at <strong>52%</strong>, indicating strong appeal among this younger demographic.</li>
          <li><strong>Gen Y</strong>: Comprises <strong>33%</strong> of new customers, showing substantial engagement from this group as well.</li>
          <li><strong>Other Generations</strong>: Only <strong>15%</strong> are from Gen X, Boomers, and the Silent Generation combined, highlighting a lower appeal to older demographics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: The program is particularly attractive to younger generations, suggesting that marketing strategies should continue to target these age groups.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="donut-chart" class="visual"></div>

      <h3>Card Activation Analysis</h3>
      <div class="text-box">
        <p>The bar chart illustrates the proportion of new customers who activated their physical cards.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Activated Cards</strong>: <strong>65%</strong> of new customers activated their physical cards, indicating a majority still use physical cards.</li>
          <li><strong>Not Activated</strong>: <strong>35%</strong> did not activate their cards, likely due to the preference for digital wallets.</li>
          <li><strong>Median Activation Time</strong>: Among those who activated their cards, the median time taken was <strong>13</strong> days.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: The significant percentage of non-activated cards suggests a shift towards digital wallets. Reducing the production and distribution of physical cards could be a cost-effective measure. Additionally, efforts to encourage quicker activation might further enhance customer engagement.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="bar-chart-2" class="visual"></div>

      <h3>Purchase Behaviour Analysis</h3>
      <div class="text-box">
        <p>The chart below shows the distribution of days until the first and fifth purchases. Key observations include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Immediate Purchases</strong>: A significant number of first purchases occur on Day 0, highlighting the importance of initial engagement. Fifth purchases start to increase after initial engagement.</li>
          <li><strong>Decline and Stabilisation</strong>: After the initial peak, purchase counts decline and stabilise, with consistent counts for fifth purchases indicating regular buying behavior among these customers.</li>
          <li><strong>>30 Peak</strong>: Both purchase types show a distinct peak at the bracket >30, suggesting that most of the new customers didn't make 5 purchases in their first 30 days.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: To improve customer engagement and purchase frequency, consider implementing targeted promotions and incentives for early purchases. Additionally, focus on strategies to convert initial transactions into regular purchases, such as loyalty programs or personalised offers.</p>

      <h3>Customer Utilisation Analysis</h3>
      <div class="text-box">
        <p>The tree hierarchy below provides a detailed analysis of how the 6,206 new customers utilised their accounts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No Transaction</strong>: <strong>760</strong> customers (12%) signed up but never made any transaction.</li>
          <li><strong>At Least One Transaction But No Purchase</strong>: <strong>872</strong> customers (14%) made transactions but no purchases.</li>
          <li><strong>At Least One But Less Than 5 Purchases</strong>: <strong>1,048</strong> customers (17%) made at least one but less than five purchases.</li>
          <li><strong>5 or More Purchases</strong>: <strong>3,526</strong> customers (57%) made 5 or more purchases.</li>
          <li><strong>5 or More Purchases After 30 Days</strong>: Within this group, <strong>1,119</strong> customers (18%) made 5 or more purchases after 30 days.</li>
          <li><strong>5 or More Purchases Within 30 Days</strong>: Within this group, <strong>2,407</strong> customers (39%) achieved this milestone within 30 days, thus claiming the extra $5 bonus.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: To enhance customer utilisation, consider strategies that encourage transactions and purchases soon after sign-up. Implementing incentives for early purchases and maintaining regular communication with new customers can help drive long-term engagement and repeat purchases.</p>

      <h3>Sampling Analysis</h3>
      <div class="text-box">
        <p>In our analysis, we examined customer activity for specific dates within January and February to determine how representative these samples are of the entire month. The proportions of active customers and their 95% confidence intervals for January 1st, January 15th, and January 31st were compared to the overall January proportion.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>January 1st</strong>: 67% (Confidence Interval: 53% to 81%)</li>
          <li><strong>January 15th</strong>: 52% (Confidence Interval: 38% to 66%)</li>
          <li><strong>January 31st</strong>: 41% (Confidence Interval: 29% to 54%)</li>
          <li><strong>Actual January Proportion</strong>: <strong>57%</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>In January, the early month sample showed a higher proportion of active customers compared to mid-month and end-of-month samples. This suggests that customers who joined early in the month were more likely to remain active. The overall proportion for January indicates that mid-month samples might be more representative of the entire month’s activity.</p>
        <p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Sampling early in the month may capture more engaged customers, but mid-month samples seem to offer a better overall reflection of customer activity throughout January.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="rect-1" class="visual"></div>

      <div class="text-box">
        <p>Similarly, we analysed February 1st, February 14th, and February 27th for February.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>February 1st</strong>: 43% (Confidence Interval: 35% to 51%)</li>
          <li><strong>February 14th</strong>: 43% (Confidence Interval: 35% to 52%)</li>
          <li><strong>February 27th</strong>: 36% (Confidence Interval: 29% to 43%)</li>
          <li><strong>Actual February Proportion</strong>: <strong>40%</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>For February, both the start-of-month and mid-month samples showed similar proportions, which were higher than the end-of-month sample. This suggests that samples taken from the start and middle of the month provide a better representation of the entire month’s activity.</p>
        <p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: When analysing customer activity or other time-sensitive data, selecting sample points from the middle of the month tends to provide a more accurate representation of the entire month. This approach minimises the variability observed at the start and end of the month, offering a balanced view of customer engagement and activity patterns.</p>
